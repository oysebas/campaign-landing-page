## 🔒 Data Privacy & Anonymization

**This is the #1 rule. No exceptions.**

ALL example outputs, training data, sample data, and test fixtures MUST be fully anonymized before commit. Real client data, revenue figures, or internal metrics are **never** acceptable in any commit.

| Data Type | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Company names | Use fictional names | "Acme Corp", "TechStart Inc" |
| Person names | Use fictional names | "Jane Smith", "John Doe" |
| Email addresses | Use example.com domain | jane@example.com |
| Phone numbers | Use 555-xxxx format | 555-0142 |
| Dollar amounts | Use round fictional numbers | $50,000 |
| API keys/tokens | Use obvious placeholders | `sk-your-key-here` |

**Before every commit**, run the sanitizer:

```bash
python3 security/sanitizer.py --scan --dir . --recursive
```

The pre-commit hook will block commits with detected PII. See [security/README.md](./security/README.md) for setup.

## Skill Structure

Every skill category requires these files:

```
skill-category/
├── SKILL.md            # Claude Code skill definition (name, description, steps)
├── README.md           # Overview, quick start, architecture, examples
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── *.py                # Implementation scripts
```

- **SKILL.md** follows Claude Code skill conventions: name, description, numbered steps.
- **README.md** includes: overview, quick start, architecture, examples, and the standard footer.
- **Python scripts** use `argparse` for CLI, include clear API stubs with comments, and handle missing dependencies gracefully.

---

## Code Standards

- **Python 3.10+**
- Use `argparse` for all CLI interfaces with `--help` documentation
- **Graceful failures:** Never crash on missing API keys. Show a helpful error message instead.
- Type hints encouraged but not required
- Prefer stdlib. No external dependencies without justification in your PR description.

```python
# Good
if not os.environ.get("API_KEY"):
    print("Error: Set API_KEY environment variable. Get one at https://...")
    sys.exit(1)

# Bad
api_key = os.environ["API_KEY"]  # KeyError if missing
```

## Telemetry Integration

New skills **must** integrate telemetry logging. See [telemetry/README.md](./telemetry/README.md) for the integration guide.

- Add a version check to your SKILL.md preamble
- **Never log sensitive data through telemetry** (API keys, PII, client data)

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repo
2. **Branch** from `main` (use descriptive branch names: `feat/email-drip-skill`, `fix/sanitizer-regex`)
3. **Build** your changes
4. **Verify** before submitting:
   - All Python files compile clean: `python3 -m py_compile your_file.py`
   - Sanitizer scan passes: `python3 security/sanitizer.py --scan --dir . --recursive`
5. **Open a PR** with a description that includes:
   - What it does
   - Which skill category it affects
   - ✅ Confirmation that all data is anonymized
